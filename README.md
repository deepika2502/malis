#### About: 
Thr project is intended to simulate the CAPTCHA which also serves to label data of unseen/ unlabelled images that are selected by the user.

Code repository for MALIS project, 2021-2022.
1. [Captcha-test.ipynb](https://github.com/deepika2502/malis/blob/master/captcha_test.ipynb) contains the implementation and training of the models to create the classifier.
2. [Main.py](https://github.com/deepika2502/malis/blob/master/main.py) contains the code to simulate the CAPTCHA and data labelling process.
3. [cnn_local_data.ipynb](https://github.com/deepika2502/malis/blob/master/cnn_local_data.ipynb) contains the code for the CCN implementation. 

The user will select images based on a class posed by the test. Based on his selection, if the results are correct and in correlation with the predicted labels by the model, the images are labelled and stored

Below is the user interface.
